# 2, set up python....
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install -U -r requirements.txt # NB. you can also make this file from your current env. by pip freeze > requirements.txt
# 3, Get it running
python runserver.py
# 4, get hacking.... 
#    and 
git -m "This is the change" blar.py
# 5, And push it back
